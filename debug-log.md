Use the code in the Arduino library to make the Capative sensor works
The code doesn't work. It says " Error Compilling"
Maybe the code isn't updated or maybe because I don't have the right resistor on arduino
upload the library to arduino 
it works!

Change the capacitive sensor to (1,4)
the LED isnt blinking anymore
Chanege the name cs_2_4 to cs_1_4
It is still not working 
Maybe the wire is broken 
Replace the wire 
Still not working 
Maybe the 1 plug doesn't work 
Change it to 8 
It works!

Blink the Led13 when the sensor is touched
the LED13 is not blinking 
Maybe something is wrong in the if statement 
Instead of (led>40), put (total1>40)
It works! The LED blinks 

Root the WAV files in the code
type in root.rewind(); call root.WAV in the loop 
It's not working 
Type in FATReader root; in the beginning of the code 
It works!

Make the wave shield play the WAV file in the SD card
Error to play 
file not the right format/size 
resize the WAV file 
JAPAN.WAV plays successfully 

Put India and Iran in the code too
Iran not playing 
file size not right
Checked and it was right 
file location not right 
Checked and it was at the same place at other files that plays 
Someting is wrong with the electronics
checked the bread board and changed a wire 
Iran plays 

Repeat the code of the first sensor that plays JAPAN.WAV to play other five audios
Indonisia won't play, says " can't play indonishia"
Mis[elling the file name 
no, nothing is mispelled 
broken wire in the circuit 
no, the wires are fine 
Something's worng with the code 
use the circuit ,that is tested out working, to play INDONISHIA
still can not play Indonishia 
shorten the name of the file to "INDO.WAV"
It works!

Resetup everything
All the data in the serial monitor shows "-2"
Something is wrong with the schematic 
replug all the wires
still not working 
Maybe the 8 is plugged into the wrong end
change the 8 from negative to positive 
It works!
