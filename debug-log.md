In a sentence, explain the behavior you expected.
In a sentence, explain the observed behavior.
Formulate a hypothesis about what might be causing the mismatch: what part of your code or what part of your circuit is behaving in a way you don't expect?
Test your hypothesis: what action can you take you determine if your hypothesis is true?
What is the result of your test?
Repeat steps iii-v above until you resolve your "bug".

Use the code in the Arduino library to make the Capative sensor works
The code doesn't work. It says " Error Compilling"
Maybe the code isn't updated or maybe because I don't have the right resistor on arduino

Blink the Led13 when the sensor is touched
the LED13 is not blinking 
Maybe soemthing is wrong in the if statement 
Instead of (led>40), put (total1>40)
It works! The LED blinks 

Repeat the code of the first sensor that plays JAPAN.WAV to play other five audios
Indonisia won't play, says " can't play indonishia"
Mis[elling the file name 
no, nothing is mispelled 
broken wire in the circuit 
no, the wires are fine 
Something's worng with the code 
use the circuit ,that is tested out working, to play INDONISHIA
still can not play Indonishia
