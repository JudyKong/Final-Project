In a sentence, explain the behavior you expected.
In a sentence, explain the observed behavior.
Formulate a hypothesis about what might be causing the mismatch: what part of your code or what part of your circuit is behaving in a way you don't expect?
Test your hypothesis: what action can you take you determine if your hypothesis is true?
What is the result of your test?
Repeat steps iii-v above until you resolve your "bug".

Use the code in the Arduino library to make the Capative sensor works
The code doesn't work. It says " Error Compilling"
Maybe the code isn't updated or maybe because I don't have the right resistor on arduino

Blink the Led13 when the sensor is touched
the LED13 is not blinking 
Maybe soemthing is wrong in the if statement 
Instead of (led>40), put (total1>40)
It works! The LED blinks
