# Final-Project
Summary  

My project is going to be a interactive terrestrial globe. The land area will be divided into countries and made out of semi-transparent plastic so that light can shine through. The sea area will be made out of non-transparent material such as wood. The way it interact with people is when people touch a country, it’ll play the music of that country or say “Hello” in the language of that country. Also when a country is touched and the sound is activated, only the area of the country will light up, everywhere else’s lights are off, until the music’s over. I will do as many country as possible, approximately 10-12. Furthermore, perhaps I can do more than just sound, but project photos of that country somehow on the globe or on the wall. This is an educational piece that helps kids learn more countries, faster and with more fun. 

Component Parts

The terrestrial globe will be made out of vacuum formed plastic. I will make a mold out of foam and then vacuum acrylic on top of it so that it’ll show the countries elevated a bit from the surface of the globe. And on the inside will be a bunch of LEDs. I’ll also buy a mini speaker to put in the globe to play the sound. 

Challenge

I think building the physical model can be very time consuming and need experiments. Getting as many languages as I can will take a while too. 

Timeline

Week 1 
Run through all the features I want my project to have and make sure they all work the way I want. If not, I can modify my design in the earlier phase.
Figure out what language I want, and look for resources. ( friends or online)
Week 2
Finish a prototype of the whole thing 
Start making the foam model 
Week3
Have the plastic vacuumed and glued together 
Maybe colored too
Combine the programming and electronic parts 
Week 4
Finish building the physical object
Make sure it works!
Week 5
In case anything happen or delayed.
