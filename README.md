# Final-Project
Summary  

My project is going to be a interactive World map. The land area will be divided into countries and made out of acrylic sheet so that light can shine through. The sea area will be made out of non-transparent material such as wood. The way it interact with people is when people touch a country, it’ll play the music of that country or say “Hello” in the language of that country. Also when a country is touched and the sound is activated, only the area of the country will light up, everywhere else’s lights are off, until the music’s over. I will do as many country as possible, approximately 10-12. Furthermore, perhaps I can do more than just sound, but project photos of that country somehow on the globe or on the wall. This is an educational piece that helps kids learn more countries, faster and with more fun. 

Component Parts

The World map will be made out of laser cut/rastered acrylic sheet. The countries area will be cut out and painted on the back so that it os not transparent. On the back of the countries I will insert capacitve sensors. And on the inside will be a bunch of LEDs. I’ll also buy a mini speaker to put in the globe to play the sound. 

Challenge

Since the acrylic sheet is transparent, I will need to figure out how to hide all the component so that it doesn't look bad. Having the piece being able to play so many language can also be challenging because the wave shield don't normally have many channels. Getting as many languages as I can will take a while too. 

Timeline

Week 1 
Run through all the features I want my project to have and make sure they all work the way I want. If not, I can modify my design in the earlier phase.
Figure out what language I want, and look for resources. ( friends or online)
Week 2
Finish a prototype of the whole thing 
Week3
Have the acrylic sheet laser cutted 
Maybe colored too
Combine the programming and electronic parts 
Week 4
Finish building the physical object
Make sure it works!
Week 5
In case anything happen or delayed.
